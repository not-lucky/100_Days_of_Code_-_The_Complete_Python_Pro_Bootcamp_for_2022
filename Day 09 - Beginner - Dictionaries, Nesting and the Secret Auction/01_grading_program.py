Instructions

You have access to a database of student_scores in the format of a dictionary. The keys in student_scores are the names of the students and the values are their exam scores.

Write a program that converts their scores to grades. By the end of your program, you should have a new dictionary called student_grades that should contain student names for keys and their grades for values. The final version of the student_grades dictionary will be checked.

DO NOT modify lines 1-7 to change the existing student_scores dictionary.

DO NOT write any print statements.

This is the scoring criteria:

    Scores 91 - 100: Grade = "Outstanding"

    Scores 81 - 90: Grade = "Exceeds Expectations"

    Scores 71 - 80: Grade = "Acceptable"

    Scores 70 or lower: Grade = "Fail"

Expected Output

'{'Harry': 'Exceeds Expectations', 'Ron': 'Acceptable', 'Hermione': 'Outstanding', 'Draco': 'Acceptable', 'Neville': 'Fail'}'
